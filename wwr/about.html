                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>IRaft activity as an adventure sport has been in existence since the 2022, if not earlier but not reecorded online, evolving from individuals paddling 10 feet (3.0 m) to 14 feet (4.3 m) rafts with double-bladed paddles or oars to multi-person rafts propelled by single-bladed paddles and steered by a person at the stern, or by the use of oars.</p>          
                <p>Our Rafting on certain sections of rivers is considered an extreme sport and can be fatal, while other sections are not so extreme or difficult. IRaft is also a competitive sport practiced within and around Nigeria which culminates in a West African rafting championship event between the participating west African countries.</p>
